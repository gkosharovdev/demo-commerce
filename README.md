# demo-commerce

Demo commerce is an opinionated e-commerce solution implemented with event-driven microservices. 

This project serves eduactional purposes only. None of the featured microservices is meant to be used in a production environment. The main point here is for me to have some fun while trying out "eventstorming-like" modeling and applying DDD.

This concrete repository contains only description of some of the problems which a fictious e-commerce would be dealing with. The individual microservies mentioned in the context map are available in separate repositories. Each of them is purposfully developed in a different style with the goal to explore a given subdomain or a solution to a technical problem. For example the [shopping-service](https://github.com/gkosharovdev/axon-kafka-spring-boot) (ft. a checkout process) is showcasing the Eventsourcing+CQRS patterns with the help of the Axon framework.

## Domain model

The approach is:
1. Create a "Big picture" artefact featuring the most relevant processes along with respective actors in Demo commerce
2. Challenge the boundaries and draw a context map
3. Transform into a "Design level" artefact wich contains the bare minimum necessary to reason about the implemnetaion

Miro is the tool of choice for those exercies.
